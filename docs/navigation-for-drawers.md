# Navigation for Create and Edit drawers

I decided to consider the Create and Detail/Edit drawers as pages. This way, the user will have a better UX using navigation.

The other option I had was to only have 1 page, and then open and close the needed drawers, but that offers a poor UX.

Managing them as pages and opening it with navigation, the user is be able to:
- Share URL directly to open the detail of a specific post
- Use browser navigation arrows to navigate between pages, making it more natural and intuitive.
